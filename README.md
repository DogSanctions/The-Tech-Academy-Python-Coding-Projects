# The Tech Academy Python Coding Projects

This repository contains all the projects I worked on while gaining a basic understanding of the Python programming language, and the Django framework. All of the apps in this program are scalable and can be applied to bigger applications after some reformatting. There is examples of abstact classes, databases, encapsulation, transferring files from one folder to another, a game created with python and a example oh polymorphism.
